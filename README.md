## My process

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### Components structure

### What I learned

- Learned how to toggle dark mode manually with Tailwind CSS (But toggling manually and based on `prefers-color-scheme` can't be used in same time)

  **Reference:** [ðŸ”—](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually)

  ```js
  /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
  export default {
    darkMode: "class",
  };
  ```

  ```html
  <span className="text-darkblue dark:text-lightgrey1">
    {content ? content : "Not Available"}
  </span>
  ```

- Learned how to set environment variables in Vite

  **Reference:** [ðŸ”—](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html)

  ```js
  const octokit = new Octokit({
    auth: import.meta.env.OCTOKIT_TOKEN,
  });
  ```
